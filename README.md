Emotion dynamics of content co-creation in fanfiction communities

It is recommended that you begin viewing the notebooks starting with general_overview, and then move on to warriors, where the steps of the analysis are explained in detail. Then proceed by viewing the remaining six communities, and conclude with final_results, where some results are drawn from combining the analysis of the seven communities.

The work is not yet final, and I reserve the right to improve the code and description of it.

A precise and formal description of the research project will be uploaded soon, along with the thesis written for this study.
